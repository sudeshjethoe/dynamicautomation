<p>For a customer I was required to extract and report data from an Oracle database<br />
Ofcourse I want to automate this task to the full extent. Normally I would use a scripting language like bash/perl/python for this task. Unfortunately, the environment did not allow for "easy" retrieval of external modules to interface with an Oracle database.</p>
<p>However, the environment did allow access tot the Oracle SQLplus instantclient. The instantclient allows running SQL-queries directly against Oracle databases, much like running "mysql -u root -p$password $mydatabase" in a MySQL environment. By piping or redirecting commands to such a "connection" we are able to extract the required information from the database.</p>
<p>Below I will outline the required steps and after I will show you snippets of the code I used for the reporting mechanism.</p>
<p>1. yum install oracle-instantclient11.2-sqlplus-11.2.0.3.0-1.i386<br />
2. useradd oracle<br />
3. edit /usr/lib/oracle/12.1/client64/network/admin/tnsnames.ora:<br />
TDIGJ =<br />
(DESCRIPTION =<br />
(ADDRESS_LIST =<br />
(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = ${IPADDRESS})(PORT = ${PORT:1521}))<br />
)<br />
(CONNECT_DATA =<br />
(SID = ${SID})<br />
)<br />
)<br />
4. test:<br />
echo "SELECT table_name FROM DICTIONARY ORDER BY table_name;" | sqlplus ${USER}@${DBNAME}/${DBPASSWD}</p>
